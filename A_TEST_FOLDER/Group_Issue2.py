"""
Proof-of-Concept for testing StrictGameBuilder.

This script creates an intentionally malformed PGN game and then parses it
using both the default GameBuilder (which suppresses errors) and the strict
version (StrictGameBuilder) that raises errors immediately.

Run this file with:
    python main.py
